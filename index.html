<h1> Nearest neighbour decision boundary </h1>
This website is dedicated to explaining and illustrating the paper called 
<strong>Nearest neighbour decision boundary</strong>, by <em>David Bremmer, Erik Demaine, 
Jeff Erickson, John Iacono, Stefan Langerman, Pat Morin, Godfried Toussaint</em>.
<h2> Problem definition </h2>
<p>The nearest neighbour problem is an optimisation problem. When receiving a new point, its goal is to find the nearest point to the new point
from a given set of points. All points have a colour (in this website we will work on a 2 colours basis : each point is either red or blue). The new
point will receive the same colour as its closest neighbour.<br>
In this case, we consider that our points are found in a limited plane surface, and the distance between them is the physical distance in the plane.</p>
<p> This problem has many real-world applications. For example, TODO </p>
<h3> More formal definition </h3>
We have a set <em>S</em> called training set of <em>n</em> points, separated in two subsets : the subset <em>R</em> (red points) and the subset <em>B</em> 
(blue points). The nearest neighbour problem aims to find the colour of a new point <em>q</em>, given the fact that <em>q</em>'s colour will be the colour
 of its closest neighbour from <em>S</em>. The nearest neighbour rule partitions the plane into a red and a blue set, which meet at the decision boundary.
<h2> Voronoi Condensing </h2>
<p>One interesting observation is that all points from the training set <em>S</em> are not useful for solving the problem, and therefore the size of the training
set can be reduced in order to obtain better time results. One method for reducing the training set size is based on the construction of Voronoi diagrams.
The method goes as follows : Construct the Voronoi diagram for the given points. For each cell, if it is only surrounded by cells of the same colour,
delete the point. This method is called <strong>Voronoi condensing</strong>. The Voronoi condensing can be done in <em>O(n logn)</em>.</p>
<p>However, we shall describe a method that allows us to do the Voronoi condensing in <em>O(n logk)</em>, where k is the numbber of points that remain
after condensing. </p>
<h2> Delaunay triangulations </h2>
The method we will use in our website is based on Delaunay triangulations. Let us first give some definitions: <br>
A <strong>Delaunay triangle</strong> in S is a triangle whose vertices <em>v1, v2, v3</em> are in S and such that the circle with <em>v1</em>, <em>v2</em> 
and <em>v3</em> on its boundary does not contain any point from S in it.<br>
A <strong>Delaunay triangulation</strong> of S is a partitioning of the convex hull of S into Delaunay triangles.<br>
A <strong>Delaunay edge</strong> is a line segment whose vertices <em>v1, v2</em> are in S and such that there exists a circle with <em>v1</em> and <em>v2</em>
on its boundary such that it does not contain any point from S in its interior.<br>
A <strong>bichromatic Delaunay edge</strong> is a Delaunay edge whose two vertices have different colours, i.e. one is red and the other one is blue.<br>
A <strong>bichromatic Delaunay triangle</strong> is a Delaunay triangle whose set of defining vertices contain two vertices of different colours, i.e. there 
is at least one blue vertex and at least one red vertex.<br>
If S is in general position (i.e. there exists no set of 4 points from S such that they all lie on the boundary of the same circle), then the Delaunay
triangulation is unique and contains all the Delaunay edges. Thus, finding all the bichromatic Delaunay edges can be used to compute the nearest neighbour
decision boundary.
<h3> Pivots </h3>
A very useful tool we will use in order to construct Delaunay triangulations is the <em>pivot operation</em>, which works as follows : <br>
Given a ray, the pivot operations returns the biggest circle whose center is on the ray, has the origin of the ray on its boundary and has no point of S 
in its interior. 
<h3> Finding the first edge </h3>
To begin, we will try to find a bichromatic edge in the set of points S. We will begin by linking any Red point from S to any blue point from S, creating a ray.

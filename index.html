<h1><span style="color: #3366ff;">Nearest neighbour decision boundary</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This website is dedicated to explaining and illustrating the paper called <strong>Nearest neighbour decision boundary</strong>, by <em>David Bremmer, Erik Demaine, Jeff Erickson, John Iacono, Stefan Langerman, Pat Morin, Godfried Toussaint</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem definition</span></h2>
<p>The nearest neighbour problem is an optimisation problem. When receiving a new point, its goal is to find the nearest point to the new point from a given set of points. All points have a colour (in this website we will work on a 2 colours basis : each point is either red or blue). The new point will receive the same colour as its closest neighbour.<br /> In this case, we consider that our points are found in a limited plane surface, and the distance between them is the physical distance in the plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More formal definition</span></h3>
<p>We have a set <em>S</em> called training set of <em>n</em> points, separated in two subsets : the subset <em>R</em> (red points) and the subset <em>B</em> (blue points). The nearest neighbour problem aims to find the colour of a new point <em>q</em>, given the fact that <em>q</em>'s colour will be the colour of its closest neighbour from <em>S</em>. The nearest neighbour rule partitions the plane into a red and a blue set, which meet at the decision boundary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voronoi Condensing</span></h2>
<p>One interesting observation is that all points from the training set <em>S</em> are not useful for solving the problem, and therefore the size of the training set can be reduced in order to obtain better time results. One method for reducing the training set size is based on the construction of Voronoi diagrams. The method goes as follows : Construct the Voronoi diagram for the given points. For each cell, if it is only surrounded by cells of the same colour, delete the point. This method is called <strong>Voronoi condensing</strong>. The Voronoi condensing can be done in <em>O(n logn)</em>. The remaining points are points that contribute to the decision boundary, the deleted ones are not.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures\VoronoiCondensing.png" alt="Voronoi Condensing" /></p>
<p>However, we shall describe a method that allows us to do the Voronoi condensing in <em>O(n logk)</em>, where k is the numbber of points that remain after condensing. If the number of points that contribute to the decision boundary is significantly smaller than the total number of points, then the complexity of our algorithm will also be significantly better. In fact, this algorithm is an output-sensitive algorithm : the running time of the algorithm is sensitive to both the input size and the output size. In this case, the output related variable is <em>k</em>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delaunay triangulations</span></h2>
<p>The method we will use in our website is based on Delaunay triangulations. Let us first give some definitions: <br /> A <span style="background-color: #ccffff;"><strong>Delaunay triangle</strong></span> in S is a triangle whose vertices <em>v1, v2, v3</em> are in S and such that the circle with <em>v1</em>, <em>v2</em> and <em>v3</em> on its boundary does not contain any point from S in it.<br /> A <span style="background-color: #ccffff;"><strong>Delaunay triangulation</strong></span> of S is a partitioning of the convex hull of S into Delaunay triangles.<br /> A <span style="background-color: #ccffff;"><strong>Delaunay edge</strong></span> is a line segment whose vertices <em>v1, v2</em> are in S and such that there exists a circle with <em>v1</em> and <em>v2</em> on its boundary such that it does not contain any point from S in its interior.<br /> A <span style="background-color: #ccffff;"><strong>bichromatic Delaunay edge</strong></span> is a Delaunay edge whose two vertices have different colours, i.e. one is red and the other one is blue.<br /> A <span style="background-color: #ccffff;"><strong>bichromatic Delaunay triangle</strong></span> is a Delaunay triangle whose set of defining vertices contain two vertices of different colours, i.e. there is at least one blue vertex and at least one red vertex.<br /> If S is in general position (i.e. there exists no set of 4 points from S such that they all lie on the boundary of the same circle), then the Delaunay triangulation is unique and contains all the Delaunay edges. Thus, finding all the bichromatic Delaunay edges can be used to compute the nearest neighbour decision boundary.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures\delaunay_and_nondelaunay_tri_example.png" alt="Two correct Delaunay Triangles." /></p>
<p>Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations are dual in the sense that an edge from a triangle in the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points unites two points whose cells would share an edge in the respective Voronoi diagram of the same set of points.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the algorithm work?</span></h3>
<p>We describe an algorithm that, given a value <em>K</em> &ge; k, finds the set of all bichromatic Delaunay edges in timple complexity <em>O((K<sup>2</sup> +n) log K)</em>, which simplifies to <em>O(n log K)</em> for&nbsp; K &le; &radic;n. Ideally, we want an algorithm which runs in <em>O(n log k).</em></p>
<p>In order to obtain the good value for K, we repeatedly try to guess it by using values of the form K = 2<sup>2<sup>i</sup></sup>, for i = 0, 1,..., log log n. Once we took a guess for the value of K, we launch the algorithm until either it finds the entire decision boundary or until it determines that K &lt; k. In the first case, the problem is solved. In the latter, we restart with the next value of K, unless now K excedes &radic;n. In this case, we stop the algorithm and run a traditional <em>O(n log n)</em> algorithm to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">What is the cost of the runs in total?</span></h3>
<p>In the worst case, we run the algorithm for all values of i from 0 to log log n. One run has the cost of <em>O(n log 2<sup>2<sup>i</sup></sup>)</em> for a fixed i. The algorithm is reitarated until either K &gt; k pr K &gt;&nbsp;&radic;n Therefore, the total cost is : &Sigma;<sub>i=0</sub> <sup>log log k</sup> <em>O(n log 2<sup>2i</sup>) = &Sigma;<sub>i=0</sub> <sup>log log k</sup> O(n2<sup>i</sup>) = O(n log k).</em></p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Pivots</span></h3>
<p>A very useful tool we will use in order to construct Delaunay triangulations is the <em>pivot operation</em>, which works as follows : <br /> Given a ray, the pivot operations returns the biggest circle whose center is on the ray, has the origin of the ray on its boundary and has no point of S in its interior.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures\pivot.png" alt="Voronoi Condensing" /></p>
<p>At the very end of this website, you can find a Canvas in which you can add red and blue points by clicking on it. This Canvas will be used to illustrate the algorithm step by step. The first step explained in the Canvas is the pivot. Therefore, in order to have a clear representation of what a pivot is, one should read the following sections, and then go perform a pivot operation in the canvas.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Finding the first edge</span></h3>
<p>To begin, we will try to find a bichromatic edge in the set of points S. We will begin by linking any Red point from S to any blue point from S, creating a ray.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">First circle</span></h4>
<p>Let's call the previously selected red point <em>r</em>, the previously selected blue point <em>b</em> and the previously formed ray <em>RAY</em>. We will apply the pivot operation with ray <em>RAY</em> on <em>B</em>, with origin on <em>r</em>. By definition of the pivot operation, the formed circle is the maximal one without any point from <em>B</em> in its interior. Therefore, there must be a point from <em>B</em>, let's call it <em>b'</em>, on the boundary of the formed circle (otherwise the circle could possibly be extended). Note that <em>b'</em> could possibly be <em>b</em>. Let's call the obtained circle <em>C</em></p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Second circle</span></h4>
<p>The first circle is done and we can now build a second one. Let us create a new ray, called <em>RAY2</em>. This ray unites <em>b'</em> and the center of <em>C</em>. We pivot on the set <em>R</em> with ray <em>RAY1</em> and origin <em>b'</em>. By doing this, we obtain a second circle, that we shall call <em>C1</em>.</p>
<p>First of all, by creation, <em>C'</em> is inside <em>C</em>. Second, we know that <em>C'</em> has <em>b'</em> and some red point <em>r'</em> on its boundary. Third, we know that there are no points of <em>B</em> in <em>C</em>. Finally, we also know that by construction there are no points from <em>R</em> in <em>C1</em>. Therefore, there is no point from <em>S</em> in <em>C1</em>. We have thus created a circle with no point from <em>S</em> in its interior and with a red point <em>r'</em> and a blue one <em>b'</em> on its boundary. We can conclude that <em>(r',b')</em> is a bichromatic edge.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a more visual explanation, you can now perform a pivot in the Canvas at the end of the page.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Why do we use this?</span></h4>
<p>Building the two circles is a sure way to find two relevant points for the decision boundary, because of the following affirmation : <em>If there is a circle with a red point r and a blue point b on its boundary, and no red (resp. blue) point in its interior, then r (resp. b) contributes to the decision boundary</em>. Therefore, by construction, we know that the two points that we have found are on the boundary of a circle with no other point in its inside, and are thus relevant to the decision boundary.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures\pivot2.png" alt="Voronoi Condensing" /></p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Bringing Complexity in</span></h4>
<p>After having observed the pivot illustration or simply after having read the above paragraphs, one can conclude that the complexity for growing the circles is ridiculously high if the points happen to have relatively big distances between them. But in fact, for any 1 &le; m &le; n, there exists a data structure of size <em>O(m)</em> that can be constructed in <em>O(n log m)</em> time and that can perform pivots in <em>O((n/m) log m)</em> time per pivot. This is done by applying Chan's data structure to partition <em>S</em> into m/n groups of size m, and applying the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick data structure on each group. The Dobkin-Kirkpatrick data structure pre-processes a set of n points in <em>O(n log n)</em> time and performs pivot queries in <em>O(log n)</em>. To perform a query, each data structure is queried and the smallest found circle is returned.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the final complexity for the Pivot? The time to construct the m/n data structures is <em>m/n * O(m log m) = O(n log m)</em>, where O(m log m) is the complexity of forming the convex hull for a set of points. Finally, as we have said, a query is performed in <em>O(log m)</em> for each data structure, thus a total of <em>m/n * O(log m) = O(n/m log m).</em></p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: #3366ff;">Finding additional points</span></h3>
<p>We shall call <em>Q</em> the subset of <em>S</em> representing the set of vertices of <em>S</em> that contribute to the decision boundary. We shall also call <em>P</em> the current set of found relevant vertices. Therefore, we have the relation <em>P</em> &sube; <em>Q</em> &sube; <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>By the rule of the two circles applied above, <em>Q</em> already contains an edge (i.e., 2 vertices). In order to find additional edges, we shall use the <strong>Augmented Delaunay triangulation</strong> method. This method consists in finding the Delaunay triangulation of <em>P</em> &cup; <em>{v1, v2, v3}</em> where <em>v1, v2, v3</em> are 3 black vertices set to infinity. We call them black in order not to give them the same colour as any of the points from <em>S</em>. Please note that <em>v1, v2, v3</em> ⊈ <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>As this website is limited in space, we were of course not able to place the three black points at infinity. We will place them far enough from each so that the triangle formed by them completly covers the area given to the user to put the points in.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures\augmentedTriangulation.png" alt="Voronoi Condensing" /></p>
<p>For any triangle <em>t</em>, we will call <em>C(t)</em> the circle that contains the 3 vertices defining <em>t</em> on its boundary. We will use the following lemma : <br /> Let &empty;&ne;<em>P</em>&sube;<em>Q</em>. The following statements are equivalent : <br /> 1. For every triangle t in the augmented Delaunay triangulation of <em>P</em>, if t has a blue (resp. red) vertex then <em>C(t)</em> does not have a red (resp. blue) point of S in its interior. <br /> 2. <em>P</em>=<em>Q</em>.</p>
<p>In order to see the placement of the black points and an example of such a triangle, the user should press the <em>Triangle</em> button besides the Canvas at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>In order to find the additional points, we will iterate on each triangle <em>t</em> from the current Delaunay triangulation of <em>P</em>. If <em>t</em> contains a blue vertex <em>b</em>, then pivot in <em>R</em> along the ray with origin at <em>b</em> and passing through <em>C(t)</em>. If the result is <em>C(t)</em> itself, move on. Else, there must be a red point <em>r</em> on the boundary of the found circle. This point should normally be in <em>Q</em>. Add <em>r</em> to <em>Q</em> and continue. The same should also be done for <em>t</em> with a red vertex (then the pivot is done on <em>B</em>). If both pivots find the circle <em>C(t)</em>, then we have proved the first subpoint of the previous lemma for <em>t</em>. When this is the result for all the triangles, we can conclude that we have found the complete set of relevant vertices. This process can be shown by clicking on the <em>Check triangles</em> button below.</p>
<p>Finally, after the entire Delaunay triangulation has been created (one can see the final triangulation by clicking on the <em>Delaunay</em> button), what is left to do is deleting the points which are not relevant. Those points have been defined earlier as the points which, in a Voronoi Diagram, have their cell surrounded by cells of points of the same colour only. When working with Delaunay triangulations, the equivalent points are the ones who share an edge only with points of the same colour. These points can be deleted as they do not contribute to the decision boundary. This can be done by clicking on the <em>Delete</em> button. In order to conclude, one can click on the second canvas at any point and a point of the correct colour will appear.</p>
